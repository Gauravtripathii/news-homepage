## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how important it is to plan everything before you start. For e.g. I did not plannned how the "New" and "Home" components will be at the same level in desktop view and created its structure without keeping the above in mind.

### Continued development

This project and other 2-3 before this were made to kind of brush up frontend (specifically React and CSS) before I go one to start making fullstack projects.
